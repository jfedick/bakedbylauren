title: school is boring
---

I'm in academics this trimester! It's no where near as much fun as labs! I'm taking Supervision for Food Service Professionals, Food Service Financials (basically accounting), Food Science, and also a Career Capstone course (resume builder). I only have these Mondays-Wednesdays, since the Career Capstone class is online. Sooooo, I have 4 day weekends...every weekend. ITS BORING! I need to find a job, or a serious hobby (that doesn't make me go broke) to fill all this free time!

Last weekend I experimented with some vegan baking. As previously stated, I was very inspired by a vegan bakery that I visited, so I did a take on one of their cupcakes: chocolate with peanut butter icing. For those who don't know, being vegan means that you don't eat any animal by-products...so no eggs, butter, milk, etc..most of which are staples when it comes to baking. After doing a little research, I found a promising recipe for chocolate cupcakes here and went at it! I ended up making my own peanut butter icing by whipping together peanut butter, powdered sugar, and soy milk. I also made a ganache filling for the center of the cupcakes! They ended up looking something like this:

Who knows what I'll get into this weekend..maybe some more job hunting! I found a blog with a recipe about making your own laundry detergent using a bar of soap ($1) , borax ($3), and washing soda ($4)! The recipe makes a very large batch, and you only need 1 tbsp of it per load! Talk about a money saver! I'm still looking for the washing soda, but I hope to find it relatively soon so I can experiment with that! It's even safe for HE washing machines! 

My mom made me enchiladas and veggie lasagna before I left for school. She even portioned them out and individually wrapped them so I could freeze and then eat whenever! YUMMY! I just had an enchilada tonight...so good! Reminds me of home and totally hit the spot! Thanks Mom! Love you!

I hope yall are having a great week!
