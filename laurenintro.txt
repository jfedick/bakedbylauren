Hey there, I’m Lauren! I’m so glad you found my site today! I am an aspiring pastry chef / self-proclaimed professional baker! I am currently in school at Johnson & Wales University, working on my bachelor’s degree in Baking and Pastry. My plan is to use this site as a way of keeping in touch with my family and friends, and also to make new ones along the way! I will be posting recipes, pictures, and different blogs about what I’m doing at school, and what I’m discovering while being away from home.  
My love for baking started out when I was a little girl; I can vividly remember using my little pink  Easy Bake Oven to make special treats for my family as often as I could. After spending two years at a liberal arts college in southeastern PA, I knew I wasn’t happy and that I needed to make some changes in my life. That’s where Johnson & Wales University comes into the picture.  I was so relieved and happy to finally find my little niche in life.
Aside from baking, you can usually find me still in the kitchen cooking some sort of vegetarian meal or reading books and magazines-Bon Appetite is a favorite. I like to work out and try to exercise as much possible..so that I can prevent the inevitable from happening given the field I am in
I want to end with a very BIG thank you to my family and friends who have supported me throughout all of my endeavors in life! You know who you are and I am truly blessed to have you all!
